Here, e.g. `barcodes.12bp.hamming3.txt` contains a pre-generated set of 12 bp barcodes with a minimum distance of 3 bp between them. See main README for more info.

<mark>**Note: shuffle the set before selecting elements!**</mark> This way this hopefully retains diversity across libraries - it would not be very nice if many libraries ended up using the first $x$ elements, for instance. (Not sure if having this repo in the first place is a good idea.)
